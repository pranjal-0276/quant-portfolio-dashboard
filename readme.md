<h1>📊 Portfolio Risk Analytics & Investment Dashboard</h1>
A full-stack financial analytics platform for portfolio risk measurement, optimization, and interactive visualization.
This system integrates historical market data storage, quantitative risk modeling, portfolio optimization, and a modern dashboard interface.

<h3>🚀 Overview</h3>
This project allows users to:
Store and manage historical stock data
Construct weighted investment portfolios
Compute return and risk metrics
Optimize portfolio allocation
Visualize analytics through an interactive dashboard
The system combines Data Science, Backend Engineering, Database Design, and Frontend Development into a single production-style architecture.
